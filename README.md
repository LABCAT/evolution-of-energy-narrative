### 5 Elements Simulation

I have an idea for the simulation I want to product based on the new functionality that we now have available.

There will be 5 elements: earth, water, wood, fire and metal

Here is a basic idea of the rules that I am thinking to implement:

If wood is touched by fire then it turns to earth

If earth is touched by fire it turns to metal

If fire is touched by water then it turns to earth

If earth is touched by water it turns to wood

Metal can not move and can not change

At the moment I think I may need to refine these rules as I can see eventually the simulation would be left with only metal and water elements.
