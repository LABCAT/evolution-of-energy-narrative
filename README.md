### Five Elements Simulation 

This simulation is based on the five element theory of Chinese philosophy or Wu Xing. The basis of this theory is that there are five elements which can be used to describe interactions between phenomena.

Wu Xing originally referred to the five major planets and based my simulation around this idea. The elements begin scattered throughout the solar system and are compelled to travel around the sun.  

In five element theory there are two types of interactions, generating and overcoming.  I have used these interactions to develop the rules of the simulation which determine when an element will changesize or transform into a different element.
