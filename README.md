### Feijoa Farm

There is a theory that feijoa trees will produce more fruit if there are other feijoa trees nearby.  Therefore the objective of this sketch is to simulate the seasonal nature of a feijoa plantation.

In this simulation an agent can have three states; seedling, tree or fruit.  An agent also is also affected by two other variables (maturity and ripeness) that affect when the agent can change state.

I think that the simulation works very well as it constantly evolves over time.  Sometimes the random mode doesn't generate  enough trees close to each other. However I think this adds to the simulation as manual intervention is then required to get the fruit to grow.
