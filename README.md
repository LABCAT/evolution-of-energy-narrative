### Data Story

Describe an interaction that could be built using data that tells a story.
This does not have to be one you are able to implement.
The subject matter can be based on the examples given in
class, or anything of interest to you. The interaction
graphic should be conveyed using three panels from
left to right.

Be sure to use complete sentences, and you can reference your 
image above. The explanation should be short but compete,
no more than [100 words](https://wordcounter.net/).

Also update both images keeping their original sizes:
