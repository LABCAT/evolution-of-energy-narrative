### T20I Cricket Match Simulator

The T20I match simulator would allow users to watch a simulation of every international T20 cricket match using historical data.  

The first panel displays a form consisting of two field sets.  The first set allows the user enter a match number to view an existing match.  The second set allows the user view a simulation of a future match by picking two teams and setting the venue.

The second panel shows the state of the simulation at the end of the first innings.  The third panel shows the state of the simulation part way through the second innings.
