### Feijoa Farm - Direction and Cell Types

For this result I have continued to experiment with my idea for a farm simulation.  

I have introduced rain which is created both by hovering over a cell and randomly if a cell has received very little rain. The rain spreads to other cells and the amount of rain a cell receives over time will determine when it becomes a tree. 

I have also introduced different climates based on the agent type. In one climate it rains more often and feijoas grow very easily.  In the other climate it rains less frequently and feijoas don't grow as well.
